About project design:
1. Because of CORS issue, I have used static data, but included all the process to fetch data from API(code is commented).
2. I used material ui and flex design for most of the styling.
3. Redux-saga part is not completly complete, I can complete it if you want by next week.
4. Used hooks and stateless components wherever possible.
